This script will pull the svn repository from http://trac.aircrack-ng.org/svn
and will convert it to git.

To transform the svn uids to the git "Firstname Surname <email@address.com>"
format the authors.txt file is used to map the uids.

On the first run it will take quite a long because it has to process all the revisions.
Future runs will be quick because it only has to process the new changes.

This script is designed to be executed periodically by cron to automatically mirror the
aircrack-ng svn repository to github.
